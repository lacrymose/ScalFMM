 Periodic Data
    1)  DLPOLY DATA  
    To check the periodic Algorithm, we consider a crystal of NaCL. The computation are done by 
    DL_POLY molecular dynamic code with the Ewald method. We only have the energy and the forces.  
    To compare with our approach we  removed the Electric moment and the new data are in the file
     called forceNacl_2000.bfma. The potential is wrong
     The new energy is Energy  7.4014682651e+01

 Energy EWALD  = -3.6662545891e+05
Energy New       =   7.4014682651e+01
