Please follow those rules when developing:

Static (variables, members, attributes) should start with a capital letter
Class name should start with a capital letter
Mix capital and normal letter to write names (IAmAName) no underscore
Put const every where it is possible (method, value, pointer etc.)
Declare variables usually as late as possible (we are not in C so do not declare every thing at the beginning of a function)
Use pre-inc if possible
If an parameter is changed by a function use pointer else use const ref
Please do not name variables with one letter (except it is related to a mathematical formula but then this one should be in the comment in latex format)
Try not to have function bigger than 100 lines
Be consistent
