I don't know if theses ideas are relevant since ScallFMM is only supposed to be a library, but as an everyday UNIX // GNU/Linux user, some things struck me.


* About the -f / -infile / -fin argument
For some reason, all tests have similar arguments that differs in name from one to another.
I suggest that this should be standardized as "-if" for "input file" and "-of" for "output file" just like in the dd UNIX command.
Therefore we won't spend anymore time wondering what the proper argument for the tool is.

* About arguments in general
Maybe it would be clearer to use one or two letters when using a single hyphen-minus and full words when using a double hyphen-minus.
Here's an exemple to make my idea clearer:
-h     | --help
-v     | --verbose
-d     | --depth
-sd    | --subdepth
-if    | --input
-of    | --output
etc...
