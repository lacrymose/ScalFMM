@article{Heyes1981,
abstract = {The Coulomb potentials and fields in infinite point charge lattices are represented by series expansions in real and reciprocal space using a method similar to that devised by Bertaut. A systematic investigation is made into the relative convergence characteristics of series derived by varying the charge spreading function which is required in the theory. A number of formulas which are already in use are compared with new expressions derived by this method.},
